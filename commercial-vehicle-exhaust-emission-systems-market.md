<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR Systems</li><li>EGR Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial vehicle exhaust emission systems market primarily consists of two key technologies: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems. SCR systems reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by injecting a urea solution into the exhaust, facilitating a chemical reaction that converts NOx into harmless nitrogen and water. In contrast, EGR systems recirculate a portion of the exhaust gas back into the engine's intake, lowering combustion temperatures and subsequently reducing NOx emissions. Both systems play a vital role in meeting stringent emission regulations.</p></p>
