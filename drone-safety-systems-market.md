<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Drone Safety Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Parachute System</li><li>Non-parachute System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Drone Safety Systems market encompasses two primary types: parachute systems and non-parachute systems. Parachute systems deploy a recovery parachute upon detecting a failure, allowing drones to descend safely and reduce impact damage. Non-parachute systems, on the other hand, utilize alternative safety mechanisms such as ballistic recovery systems or robust designs that enable controlled landings or crash mitigation. Both types aim to enhance safety, minimize accidents, and protect both the drone and surrounding environments during unexpected failures.</p></p>
