<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neonatal ventilator market is divided into two primary types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilation involves the use of endotracheal intubation, where a tube is inserted into the trachea to support breathing in critically ill neonates. This method is often used for severe respiratory distress. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, employs devices like CPAP or BiPAP to provide respiratory support without intubation, minimizing discomfort and reducing the risk of complications, ideal for milder respiratory issues.</p></p>
