<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemostasis Testing Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Congenital Bleeding Disorders</li><li>Acquired Bleeding Disorders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hemostasis testing systems evaluate the blood's ability to form clots and regulate bleeding. The market is divided into congenital and acquired bleeding disorders. Congenital bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia, are genetic conditions where the body lacks specific clotting factors, necessitating precise testing for effective management. Acquired bleeding disorders, resulting from factors like liver disease or anticoagulant medications, require different testing approaches to assess clotting function and guide treatment. Both markets are essential for diagnosis and monitoring patient care.</p></p>
