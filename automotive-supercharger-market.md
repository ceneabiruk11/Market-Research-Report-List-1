<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Supercharger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Twin-Screw</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive supercharger market features two primary types: centrifugal and twin-screw superchargers. Centrifugal superchargers utilize a rotating impeller to create boost by drawing and compressing air, commonly found in performance cars due to their efficiency at high RPMs. In contrast, twin-screw superchargers consist of two interlocking rotors that compress air as it moves through the unit, providing instant boost with lower RPM performance, making them ideal for applications requiring quick throttle response and enhanced torque. Each type serves distinct automotive performance needs.</p></p>
