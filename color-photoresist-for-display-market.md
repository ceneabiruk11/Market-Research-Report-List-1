<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color Photoresist for Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Color photoresist is a crucial material in the display market, used for patterning during manufacturing processes. Positive photoresist becomes soluble when exposed to light, allowing for precise designs to be developed, making it ideal for applications needing fine details. Negative photoresist, conversely, hardens upon exposure, leaving the unexposed areas soluble, which provides robustness in structured patterns. Both types are essential for creating high-resolution displays, with their unique properties catering to different manufacturing requirements in the display technology landscape.</p></p>
